The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most well-known maritime disasters in history. It is also a popular dataset in Kaggle for enthusiastic data nerds. 

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the "unsinkable" Titanic struck an iceberg and tragically sank. Due to a shortage of lifeboats, 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew lost their lives.

Although survival was influenced by luck to some extent, certain factors seemed to increase the likelihood of survival for specific groups of people.

In this challenge, the task is to build a predictive ML model to answer the question: *"What types of passengers were more likely to survive?"* by using data such as passenger names, ages, genders, and socio-economic class.
Feel free to fork out/create new branch and play around with the data.
